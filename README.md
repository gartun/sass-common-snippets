## Sass Snippets for Common Usage
This is the repo of some code snippets that I've gathered, am gathering and will gather. It's more of a reference repo to me rather than a project repo.

> Important! I recommend you to download **Sass** to your system globally via **npm** or **yarn**(npm i -g sass). That way, you can use script/cmd files in each folder to run Sass.

### How to test out examples
1. Clone this repo
```cmd
git clone address-to-this-repo/sass-common-snippets
```
2. `cd` into the example folder that you want to see the result of. 
```cmd
cd sass-common-snippets/down-arrow
```
3. Run the **npm** script.
```sh
npm run sass
# or
yarn sass
```
4. After Sass code is converted into Css code, open the *index.html* file in a browser.

> Note: If you want to try stuff with Sass code and don't want to repeat step 3 every time you change something; run `npm run sass:w` or `yarn sass:w`.
